I'm currently contributing to the development of trustworthy large language models (LLMs) at OpenMMLab. I'll join the Department of Computer Science at UC Irvine in 2023 Fall as a Ph.D. student.

- 🔬 I completed my B.Eng at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I also spent time working at Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.
- 🔭 I worked on Computer Vision, Adversarial Machine Learning, and Out-of-distribution Robustness, especially in the context of autonomous driving.
- ⚽ Football is my favorite.
