I am an undergraduate student in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I'll join the Department of Computer Science at UC Irvine in 2023 Fall as a Ph.D. student.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Computer Vision, Adversarial Machine Learning, and Out-of-distribution Robustness, especially in the context of autonomous driving.
- 🔬 I'll join OpenMMLab at Shanghai AI Lab as a research intern in 2023 summer. Before that, I spent time at Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.
- ⚽ Football is my favorite.
